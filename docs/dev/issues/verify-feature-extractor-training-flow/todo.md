# Verify Feature Extractor Training Flow — TODO

- [x] Phase 3.1 — create issue doc folder and ensure tmp outputs ignored.
- [x] Phase 3.2 — land contract and integration/unit tests (JSON, Markdown, single-thread, vectorized, hardware probe).
- [x] Phase 3.3 — implement training dataclasses, helpers, script refactor, configs, and logging updates.
- [x] Phase 3.4 — wire helpers into automation and re-export entry points if required.
- [x] Phase 3.5 — refresh documentation, changelog, and TODO status as work ships.
- [ ] Phase 3.6 — run targeted suites, integration flows, quickstart validation, and full lint/test gates.
