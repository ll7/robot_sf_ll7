# Social Force Planner Default Configuration
# 
# This configuration provides sensible defaults for the Social Force planner
# that work well across a variety of scenarios. Parameters are documented
# with their physical meaning and typical ranges.

# Kinematics and Control
mode: "velocity"  # Control mode: "velocity" (vx, vy) or "unicycle" (v, omega)
v_max: 2.0        # Maximum linear velocity [m/s]
omega_max: 1.0    # Maximum angular velocity [rad/s] (unicycle mode only)
accel_max: 2.0    # Maximum acceleration [m/sÂ²] (for future use)
dt: 0.1           # Integration timestep [s] (can be overridden by environment)

# Goal Dynamics
desired_speed: 1.0  # Preferred movement speed towards goal [m/s]
tau: 0.5           # Relaxation time for desired force [s] - controls acceleration

# Social Force Parameters
# These control repulsion between agents (pedestrians and robot)
A: 5.1                # Social force amplitude [N] - strength of repulsion
B: 0.35              # Social force range parameter [m] - decay distance
lambda_anisotropy: 2.0  # Anisotropy factor - stronger repulsion in front
sigma_phi: 90.0      # Field of view angle [degrees] for anisotropic forces
cutoff_radius: 10.0  # Maximum interaction distance [m] - ignore distant agents

# Obstacle Force Parameters  
# These control repulsion from static obstacles (walls, barriers)
A_obs: 10.0  # Obstacle force amplitude [N] - strength of wall repulsion
B_obs: 0.0   # Obstacle force range parameter [m] - typically small for hard walls

# Body Contact Forces (Optional)
# These handle physical contact between agents - typically disabled for prediction
k_body: 0.0      # Body force stiffness [N/m] - set > 0 to enable contact forces
kappa_slide: 0.0 # Sliding friction coefficient - for tangential contact forces

# Numerical Integration
integration: "euler"    # Integration method: "euler" or "semi_implicit"
clip_force: true       # Whether to clip forces to prevent numerical instability
max_force: 100.0       # Maximum total force magnitude [N] when clipping enabled

# Stochasticity Control
noise_std: 0.0  # Standard deviation of force noise [N] - set > 0 for stochastic behavior

# Input/Output Configuration
action_space: "velocity"  # Output action format: "velocity" or "unicycle"
safety_clamp: true       # Whether to enforce velocity/acceleration limits

# Parameter Notes:
#
# - A and A_obs control the strength of repulsive forces. Higher values mean
#   stronger avoidance but may cause oscillations if too high.
#
# - B and B_obs control the range of repulsive forces. Smaller values create
#   sharper force profiles that activate closer to obstacles/agents.
#
# - tau controls how quickly the agent accelerates towards goals. Smaller
#   values cause faster response but may be less stable.
#
# - desired_speed should typically match the robot's preferred operating speed.
#   The planner will automatically reduce speed near goals.
#
# - lambda_anisotropy > 1 creates stronger repulsion in the forward direction,
#   modeling the tendency to avoid agents in one's path more than those behind.
#
# - cutoff_radius limits computational cost by ignoring distant agents. Should
#   be set large enough to capture relevant interactions (typically 5-20m).
#
# - For deterministic behavior, keep noise_std = 0 and use consistent seeding.
#
# - safety_clamp should generally be true to prevent commands that exceed
#   robot physical limits or violate safety constraints.
