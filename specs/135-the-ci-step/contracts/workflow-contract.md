# CI Workflow Contract: System Package Installation

## Overview
This contract defines the interface and behavior of the optimized CI system package installation step.

## Workflow Step Interface

### Input
- **Environment**: Ubuntu-latest GitHub Actions runner
- **Prerequisites**: uv installed, Python set up
- **Required Packages**: ffmpeg, libglib2.0-0, libgl1, fonts-dejavu-core

### Output
- **Success**: All packages installed and available
- **Failure**: Installation error with non-zero exit code
- **Metrics**: Installation duration captured

### Behavior Contract

#### Functional Requirements
1. **FR-001**: Must install all required packages successfully
   - Request: `install_packages(["ffmpeg", "libglib2.0-0", "libgl1", "fonts-dejavu-core"])`
   - Response: Success (exit code 0) with packages available
   - Error: Failure (exit code > 0) with error message

2. **FR-002**: Must complete within performance threshold
   - Request: Any installation command
   - Response: Completion within 73 seconds
   - SLA: 95% of runs under threshold

3. **FR-003**: Must maintain headless testing capability
   - Request: Installation completes
   - Response: pygame and matplotlib work in headless mode
   - Validation: Subsequent test steps pass

#### Non-Functional Requirements
1. **NFR-001**: Zero failure rate
   - Availability: 100% success rate
   - MTTR: N/A (failures not acceptable)

2. **NFR-002**: Consistent performance
   - Latency: < 73 seconds P95
   - Throughput: N/A (single execution per CI run)

### Implementation Options Contract

#### Option A: Package Caching
```
Interface: cache-enabled installation
Input: package list, cache key
Output: packages installed (cache hit) or downloaded (cache miss)
Contract: Cache hit < 30 seconds, cache miss < 73 seconds
```

#### Option B: Fast Package Manager
```
Interface: accelerated package manager
Input: package list
Output: packages installed via parallel downloads
Contract: < 73 seconds average, maintains compatibility
```

#### Option C: Pre-built Container
```
Interface: container-based execution
Input: container image with packages
Output: CI environment with packages pre-installed
Contract: < 10 seconds setup, maintains workflow compatibility
```

### Error Handling Contract

#### Package Installation Failure
- **Trigger**: apt-get install returns non-zero
- **Response**: Fail CI job immediately
- **Logging**: Include package name and error details
- **Recovery**: Manual intervention required

#### Network Timeout
- **Trigger**: Download takes > 5 minutes
- **Response**: Fail CI job with timeout error
- **Logging**: Include partial progress
- **Recovery**: Retry on next CI run

#### Cache Corruption
- **Trigger**: Cache restore fails validation
- **Response**: Fall back to fresh installation
- **Logging**: Warning about cache bypass
- **Recovery**: Automatic on next run

### Monitoring Contract

#### Metrics Collected
- `package_installation_duration`: seconds
- `cache_hit`: boolean
- `packages_installed`: count
- `download_size`: bytes

#### Alerts
- Duration > 73 seconds: Warning
- Installation failure: Critical
- Cache miss rate > 50%: Info

### Compatibility Contract

#### Supported Environments
- Ubuntu 20.04, 22.04, 24.04
- GitHub Actions runners
- Network: Reliable internet connection

#### Dependencies
- sudo access for package installation
- apt package manager available
- GitHub Actions cache service

### Versioning Contract

#### Backward Compatibility
- Package list changes require spec update
- Performance thresholds are minimum requirements
- New optimization methods must not break existing behavior

#### Forward Compatibility
- Additional packages can be added
- New metrics can be added without breaking existing
- Implementation methods can be changed if contracts maintained
