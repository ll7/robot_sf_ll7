# Candidate Report: orca_prior_guarded_ppo_v1 (smoke)

## Decision

pass

## Hypothesis

A near-field ORCA prior can act as a residual correction on the existing PPO action, preserving learned goal-seeking behavior while biasing crowded encounters toward the repository's strongest reciprocal-avoidance safety baseline before the generic risk-DWA fallback is needed.
