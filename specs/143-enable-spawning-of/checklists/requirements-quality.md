# Requirements Quality Checklist: Single Pedestrian Spawning and Control

**Purpose**: Validate the quality, clarity, and completeness of requirements for single pedestrian spawning and control
**Created**: October 17, 2025
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Requirement Completeness
- [ ] CHK001 - Are all necessary requirements for single pedestrian spawning, goal navigation, and trajectory following explicitly documented? [Completeness, Spec §Functional Requirements]
- [ ] CHK002 - Are requirements for error handling and edge cases (e.g., invalid coordinates, duplicate IDs, overlapping agents) specified? [Completeness, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [ ] CHK003 - Are requirements for visualization of pedestrian elements (starts, goals, trajectories) included? [Completeness, Spec §User Story 4]

## Requirement Clarity
- [ ] CHK004 - Are terms like "goal", "trajectory", "start position" clearly defined and unambiguous? [Clarity, Spec §Key Entities]
- [ ] CHK005 - Are requirements for mutually exclusive goal/trajectory behavior unambiguous? [Clarity, Spec §Functional Requirements]
- [ ] CHK006 - Are validation and error messaging requirements specific and clear? [Clarity, Spec §Functional Requirements]

## Requirement Consistency
- [ ] CHK007 - Are requirements for single and multi-pedestrian scenarios consistent across all user stories? [Consistency, Spec §User Story 5]
- [ ] CHK008 - Are requirements for integration with existing map and robot behavior consistent with backward compatibility goals? [Consistency, Spec §Functional Requirements]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality
- [ ] CHK009 - Are success criteria measurable and technology-agnostic (e.g., configuration time, navigation accuracy, visual clarity)? [Acceptance Criteria, Spec §Measurable Outcomes]
- [ ] CHK010 - Are acceptance scenarios for each user story independently testable? [Acceptance Criteria, Spec §User Scenarios & Testing]

## Scenario Coverage
- [ ] CHK011 - Are requirements defined for all primary, alternate, and exception scenarios (e.g., static pedestrians, unreachable goals, trajectory through obstacles)? [Coverage, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [ ] CHK012 - Are requirements for multiple single pedestrians and their interactions with other agents covered? [Coverage, Spec §User Story 5]

## Edge Case Coverage
- [ ] CHK013 - Are boundary conditions and negative scenarios (e.g., empty trajectory, overlapping start positions) addressed in requirements? [Edge Case, Spec §Edge Cases]

## Non-Functional Requirements
- [ ] CHK014 - Are performance requirements (≤10% per-step simulation time increase) specified and measurable? [Non-Functional, Spec §Measurable Outcomes]
- [ ] CHK015 - Are reproducibility and deterministic behavior requirements documented? [Non-Functional, Spec §Measurable Outcomes]
- [ ] CHK016 - Are documentation and usability requirements (e.g., example scripts, docs updates) included? [Non-Functional, Spec §Success Criteria]

## Dependencies & Assumptions
- [ ] CHK017 - Are all dependencies (PySocialForce, map parser, visualization) and key assumptions documented and validated? [Dependencies, Spec §Dependencies & Assumptions]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts
- [ ] CHK018 - Are all ambiguous terms, potential conflicts, and open questions resolved or explicitly documented? [Ambiguity, Spec §Open Questions]
