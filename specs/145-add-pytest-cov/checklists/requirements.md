# Specification Quality Checklist: Code Coverage Monitoring and Quality Tracking

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-23  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality Review
✅ **PASSED** - The specification focuses entirely on what the system should do (collect coverage, warn on decreases, identify gaps, track trends) without specifying how (pytest-cov is mentioned only in the feature name, not in requirements).

✅ **PASSED** - All requirements are framed around user and developer needs: non-intrusive testing, actionable warnings, gap identification, historical visibility.

✅ **PASSED** - Language is accessible to non-technical stakeholders (e.g., "coverage percentage," "modules," "warnings" rather than technical implementation details).

✅ **PASSED** - All mandatory sections present: User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria, with optional sections (Key Entities, Assumptions) appropriately included.

### Requirement Completeness Review
✅ **PASSED** - No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers exist. All ambiguities have been resolved with reasonable defaults documented in the Assumptions section.

✅ **PASSED** - Each functional requirement can be tested objectively:
- FR-001: Verify coverage collection runs automatically
- FR-002: Verify terminal output contains summary
- FR-003: Verify CI integration doesn't fail builds
- FR-004: Verify warnings identify modules and changes
- FR-005: Verify gap analysis command produces ranked list
- (All 15 requirements have clear test criteria)

✅ **PASSED** - Success criteria include specific numbers and measurable outcomes:
- SC-001: "under 10% additional time overhead"
- SC-002: "90% of test runs complete successfully"
- SC-003: "warnings for decreases of 1% or more"
- SC-004: "top 10 coverage gaps in under 30 seconds"
- (All criteria are quantifiable or objectively verifiable)

✅ **PASSED** - Success criteria avoid implementation details:
- Focus on outcomes (time, completion rate, warnings)
- No mention of specific tools, databases, or frameworks
- Use generic terms like "terminal output," "CI pipeline," "reports"

✅ **PASSED** - Each user story contains multiple acceptance scenarios in Given/When/Then format covering normal and edge cases.

✅ **PASSED** - Edge cases section identifies 6 specific scenarios:
- Failed tests with no coverage data
- Newly added files without baselines
- Corrupted coverage data
- Excluded directories
- Missing baseline branch data
- Parallel test execution

✅ **PASSED** - Scope is bounded by 4 prioritized user stories (P1-P4), with clear assumptions about what's in/out of scope (e.g., focus on robot_sf/ directory, exclusion of examples/).

✅ **PASSED** - Assumptions section lists 10 specific dependencies and constraints, including framework choice, directory structure, CI capabilities, and acceptable overhead.

### Feature Readiness Review
✅ **PASSED** - All 15 functional requirements link to acceptance scenarios in user stories and success criteria measurements.

✅ **PASSED** - User scenarios cover the complete flow from basic coverage collection (P1) through CI integration (P2), gap analysis (P3), and historical tracking (P4).

✅ **PASSED** - Feature delivers on success criteria: non-intrusive collection, CI warnings, gap identification, trend tracking all map to measurable outcomes.

✅ **PASSED** - Specification maintains abstraction level appropriate for requirements phase (no pytest-cov configuration details, no specific file formats beyond "HTML, JSON").

## Notes

All checklist items passed on first validation. The specification is complete, testable, and ready to proceed to the next phase (`/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`).

**Strengths**:
- Clear prioritization with independent testing for each user story
- Comprehensive edge case coverage
- Well-defined success criteria with specific numeric targets
- Detailed assumptions document project-specific defaults

**Ready for**: Planning phase (`/speckit.plan`)
