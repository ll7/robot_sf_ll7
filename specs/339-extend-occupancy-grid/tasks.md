## Parallel Execution Strategy

### Parallel Opportunities within Phases

**Phase 2 (Foundational)**:
- T006–T009 (utility functions, coordinate transforms, rasterization) can run in parallel (different files, no inter-task dependencies)
- T012–T013 (test fixtures) can run in parallel

**Phase 3 (US1)**:
- T015–T021 (unit tests) can run in parallel (independent test cases)
- T025–T029 (implementation components: indexing, transforms, channel population) can run in parallel
- All T015–T021 tests can run in parallel before any implementation tasks

**Phase 4 (US2)**:
- T034–T037 (unit tests) can run in parallel
- T042–T044 (config, reset, step modifications) can run in parallel after T041

**Phase 5 (US3)**:
- T049–T058 (query tests) can run in parallel
- T060–T062 (query implementations: point, circular, rectangular) can run in parallel

**Phase 6 (US4)**:
- T068–T074 (visual tests) can run in parallel
- T077–T080 (rendering implementations: color mapping, transforms, blending) can run in parallel

**Phase 7 (US5)**:
- T086–T097 (edge case and error path tests) can run in parallel
- T100–T103 (instrumentation: docstrings, type hints, refactoring) can run in parallel

**Phase 8 (Polish)**:
- T105–T111 (documentation and examples) can run in parallel
- T113–T114 (validation scripts) can run in parallel

### Example Parallel Execution Plan

**Fast-path for MVP (User Story 1 only)**:
```
Phase 1 → Phase 2 → Phase 3 (T015-T032, excluding T033 logging)
Expected timeline: 4–6 sprints for core functionality
```

**Full feature delivery (all user stories)**:
```
Phase 1 → Phase 2 → (Phase 3 + Phase 4 + Phase 5 + Phase 6 in parallel) → Phase 7 → Phase 8
Expected timeline: 8–12 sprints for complete feature with 100% coverage
```

**Recommended first sprint** (5–7 tasks):
- T001: Setup
- T006, T007, T008, T009: Foundational utilities (parallelizable)
- T002, T003, T004: Data model classes (parallelizable)

---

## Implementation Notes

### MVP Scope (User Stories 1 & 2)
Implement grid creation/update and gymnasium integration first. This delivers core value (occupancy observation for RL) without queries or visualization. Recommended for initial 4-week sprint.

### MVP-2 Scope (Add US3)
Add POI/AOI query API for spawn validation. Recommended for week 5–6.

### Full Scope (Add US4 & US5)
Complete with visualization and 100% coverage. Recommended for weeks 7–12.

### Key Dependencies
- Phase 2 must complete before any user story (blocking)
- US1 must complete before US2 (gymnasium integration depends on grid data structures)
- US3 can start after Phase 2 (independent from US2)
- US4 can start after Phase 2 (visualization independent from queries)
- US5 (testing) can start after US1, but coverage validation requires all stories complete

### File Structure Summary
- **Core module**: `robot_sf/nav/occupancy.py` (grid generation, queries, utility functions)
- **Configuration**: `robot_sf/gym_env/unified_config.py` (GridConfig dataclass)
- **Gymnasium integration**: `robot_sf/gym_env/environment.py` (grid in observation space)
- **Visualization**: `robot_sf/render/sim_view.py` (pygame rendering)
- **Tests**: `tests/test_occupancy_*.py` (4 files), `test_pygame/test_occupancy_visualization.py`
- **Documentation**: `docs/dev/occupancy/Update_or_extend_occupancy.md` (usage guide)
- **Examples**: `examples/advanced/` and `examples/quickstart/` (demo scripts)

## Next Steps

1. **Start Phase 1**: Initialize feature branch and verify documentation (T001).
2. **Complete Phase 2**: Build foundational utilities and test fixtures (T006–T014). This unblocks all user stories.
3. **Parallel User Story Implementation**: Execute Phases 3–7 according to priority (US1 & US2 first for MVP).
4. **Finalize**: Documentation, examples, validation, and merge (Phase 8).

**Estimated timeline**: 8–12 weeks for full feature with 100% coverage and all user stories complete.
