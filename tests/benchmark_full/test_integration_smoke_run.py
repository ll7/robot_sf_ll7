"""Contract integration test T016 for `run_full_benchmark` smoke path.

Expectation (current skeleton T029):
  - Creates base directory tree: episodes/, aggregates/, reports/, plots/ under output_root.
  - Writes manifest.json with required keys.
  - Generates an episodes.jsonl file with at least initial episode batch (>=1 line).
  - In smoke mode videos are skipped (no videos/ directory required yet).

Later tasks (T035+) will add plots content; for now only directory creation asserted.
