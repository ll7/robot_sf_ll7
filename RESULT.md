# PR #6059 review-blocker remediation

## Fixed comments

- Fixed the provenance-semantics blocker across all 18 Issue #4848 and #4891 exemplar bundles.
  `metadata.json` and embedded `trace_series.json` now preserve
  `git_commit` as `missing:original-generation-commit-not-recoverable`; the reachable
  `0b0214ced856eac77fa9a4c15b02921eabab1661` is recorded only as the distinct
  `published_integration_commit` pointer. README files now label generation provenance as
  unavailable and identify the integration pointer as not the generation commit.
- Refreshed all 18 per-directory `SHA256SUMS` files.
- Updated the PR description to match the remediation: `git_commit` remains unavailable,
  while `published_integration_commit` identifies the reachable byte-identical integration
  source; stale repointing language and file-count text were removed.
- No unresolved inline review threads were present before the fix; no thread was resolved.

## Validation

- `git fetch origin main` and `git merge origin/main` — passed; base was current.
- Provenance consistency probe over 18 bundles — passed.
- `uv run python scripts/tools/lint_evidence_registry.py --strict --strict-exclusion-policy docs/context/evidence/evidence_registry_strict_ci_policy.yaml` — passed; active findings 0.
- `uv run python scripts/dev/evidence_registry_ratchet.py --check` — passed; findings 414, baseline 414.
- `uv run pytest tests/dev/test_evidence_registry_ratchet.py tests/test_export_issue_4848.py tests/tools/test_audit_exemplar_bundles.py -q` — passed; 78 tests.
- `uv run python scripts/dev/check_docs_evidence_integrity.py --files <72 changed evidence files>` — passed.
- `git diff --check` — passed.
- PR body verification — passed; the stale `Repointed the producer pointer` claim is absent,
  and the description names `missing:original-generation-commit-not-recoverable` and
  `published_integration_commit`.
- `BASE_REF=origin/main scripts/dev/pr_ready_check.sh` — blocked by pre-existing untracked lease task files; this is the known changed-file proof limitation tracked by issue #5533. The focused evidence gates above passed.

## Live PR state after push

- PR head: updated after the reporting commit on `cheap/cheap-issue-5986-e4ebaff0d9c5`.
- Hosted checks were queued/in progress after the push; `reproducibility-check` remained
  `SKIPPED`.
- `reviewDecision` remained empty/null.

## Blockers

- Hosted `reproducibility-check` remains `SKIPPED`; this lease forbids compute submission, so it cannot be replaced here.
- GitHub `reviewDecision` remains null/empty: the only submitted review is Gemini Code Assist `COMMENTED`; an authorized human approval is still required.
