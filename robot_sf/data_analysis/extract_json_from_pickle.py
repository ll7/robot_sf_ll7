"""
Module for converting the latest simulation recording from pickle to JSON format.

This module performs the following:
- Finds the most recent recording file in the 'recordings' folder.
- Loads the simulation states from that file.
- Converts the simulation states into a JSON serializable format.
- Saves the converted data as a JSON file named after the recording's timestamp.
