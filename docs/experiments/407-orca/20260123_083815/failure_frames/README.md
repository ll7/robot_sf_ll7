# Failure Frames Note

These images are kept to preserve a compact visual record of ORCA failure modes
(e.g., narrow passages, crowd compression, collision geometry) for the 2026-01-23
baseline sweep. They support later debugging, regression checks, and benchmark
write-ups without re-running the full video extraction.

You may remove these images if:
- Storage is constrained and the baseline run is no longer referenced.
- A newer baseline supersedes this one and its failure analysis is documented.
- The same failure modes are captured in a smaller summary (e.g., contact sheets only).

If you remove them, update the associated experiment docs to avoid broken references.
