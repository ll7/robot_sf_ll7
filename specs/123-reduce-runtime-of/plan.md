# Implementation Plan: Accelerate Reproducibility Integration Test

**Branch**: `123-reduce-runtime-of` | **Date**: 2025-09-20 | **Spec**: `/Users/lennart/git/robot_sf_ll7/specs/123-reduce-runtime-of/spec.md`
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/123-reduce-runtime-of/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Primary requirement: Reduce runtime of the reproducibility integration test while preserving deterministic guarantees (episode ordering + scenario hash).
Approach (from research): Minimize episodes (2 total), disable heavy artifacts (videos/plots, bootstrap), enforce workers=1, add soft timing assertion, retain full planning/execution path for authenticity.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Python 3.13 (repo current)  
**Primary Dependencies**: pytest, benchmark modules (`robot_sf.benchmark.full_classic`), standard library  
**Storage**: Local filesystem (temporary output dirs)  
**Testing**: pytest integration test (accelerated)  
**Target Platform**: macOS/Linux CI (headless)  
**Project Type**: Single research/benchmark Python project  
**Performance Goals**: Test <2s local, <4s CI wall time  
**Constraints**: Deterministic episode ordering & hash; avoid heavy artifact generation  
**Scale/Scope**: Narrow (single test optimization)  

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

Assessment vs Constitution (Principles I–X):
- Reproducibility (I): Improved by making determinism test faster → PASS
- Factory Abstraction (II): Test will continue using factories implicitly via orchestrator → PASS
- Benchmark & Metrics (III): Keeps focus on episode record determinism → PASS
- Unified Config (IV): Minimal seeds still use config pathway → PASS
- Minimal Baselines (V): Not affected → PASS
- Statistical Rigor (VI): Excluding bootstrap here is acceptable (test purpose is structural) → PASS
- Backward Compatibility (VII): No public schema change → PASS
- Documentation as API (VIII): Spec + quickstart provided → PASS
- Test Coverage (IX): Maintains coverage; adds performance guard → PASS
- Scope Discipline (X): Narrow improvement; in scope → PASS

No violations; Complexity Tracking remains empty.

**Structure Decision**: Option 1 (single project) – no new source tree needed.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh copilot` for your AI assistant
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each contract → contract test task [P]
- Each entity → model creation task [P] 
- Each user story → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation 
- Dependency order: Models before services before UI
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 25-30 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
No deviations from constitution; table intentionally empty.


## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
- [X] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
- [X] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command)
- [ ] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - describe approach only)
- [ ] Phase 3: Tasks generated (/tasks command)
- [ ] Phase 4: Implementation complete

**Gate Status**:
- [X] Initial Constitution Check: PASS
- [X] Post-Design Constitution Check: PASS
- [X] All NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved
- [X] Complexity deviations documented (none)
