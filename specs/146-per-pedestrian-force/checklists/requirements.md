# Specification Quality Checklist: Per-Pedestrian Force Quantiles

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-24  
**Feature**: [../spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Pass: All Items Complete âœ…

The specification successfully meets all quality criteria:

1. **Content Quality**: The spec is written in plain language focusing on user needs (benchmark analysts, researchers) without mentioning specific Python libraries, NumPy functions, or code structure.

2. **Requirements**: All 14 functional requirements are testable and unambiguous. For example, FR-001 clearly states "compute force magnitude quantiles for each individual pedestrian separately" which can be verified through unit tests.

3. **Success Criteria**: All 6 success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic:
   - SC-001: Distinguishing force patterns (behavioral outcome)
   - SC-002: Performance target (5ms for 100 timesteps, 20 pedestrians)
   - SC-003: Test coverage (quantifiable pass/fail)
   - SC-004: Documentation completeness (verifiable checklist)
   - SC-005: Schema compatibility (no breaking changes)
   - SC-006: Demonstration of value (20% difference threshold)

4. **Edge Cases**: Five edge cases clearly identified with proposed resolution strategies documented in Assumptions section.

5. **Scope**: Clear boundaries established with Out of Scope section excluding visualization, SNQI integration, and alternative metrics.

## Notes

- Edge case policies are documented as proposed defaults in the Assumptions section, allowing flexibility during implementation while providing clear initial guidance.
- The naming convention (`ped_force_qXX`) is documented to distinguish from existing `force_qXX` metrics.
- Performance target (SC-002) is realistic based on vectorized NumPy operations for typical benchmark scenarios.
- The specification is ready for the next phase: `/speckit.plan` to create implementation tasks.
