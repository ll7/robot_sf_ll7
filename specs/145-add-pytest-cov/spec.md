# Feature Specification: Code Coverage Monitoring and Quality Tracking

**Feature Branch**: `145-add-pytest-cov`  
**Created**: 2025-10-23  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "add pytest-cov to the project. Make the default implementation non intrusive and informative. Create a cicd integration that does not fail, but warns when coverage decreases. create methods to monitor quality metrics over time. Create methods to automatically identify the biggest code coverage gaps."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Run Tests with Coverage Information (Priority: P1)

Developers run the standard test suite and automatically receive coverage information without needing to change their workflow or remember special flags. Coverage reports are displayed in a clear, actionable format that highlights tested and untested code.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundation of the entire feature. Without non-intrusive coverage collection, developers won't adopt the tool and other features become irrelevant.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running the existing test command and verifying that coverage data is collected and displayed without requiring configuration changes, and delivers immediate value by showing which parts of the codebase are tested.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a developer runs the standard test command, **When** tests complete, **Then** coverage percentage for each module is displayed in the terminal output
2. **Given** tests are run successfully, **When** viewing the output, **Then** a summary shows overall coverage percentage and identifies modules below coverage thresholds
3. **Given** no previous coverage configuration exists, **When** running tests for the first time, **Then** the system works without requiring setup or configuration files

---

### User Story 2 - Receive Coverage Warnings in CI/CD (Priority: P2)

When code is pushed to the repository, the CI/CD pipeline automatically checks if test coverage has decreased compared to the main branch. If coverage drops, the build still passes but generates a clear warning message identifying which modules lost coverage.

**Why this priority**: This prevents coverage regression over time while maintaining a non-blocking workflow that doesn't frustrate developers with failing builds for minor coverage decreases.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a pull request that reduces coverage, verifying the CI pipeline passes with warnings, and confirms that maintainers receive notification about the coverage decrease.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a pull request reduces overall coverage by any amount, **When** CI runs, **Then** the build passes with a warning comment showing the coverage decrease
2. **Given** a pull request maintains or improves coverage, **When** CI runs, **Then** the build passes without warnings and may include a positive coverage status
3. **Given** coverage decreases in specific modules, **When** CI completes, **Then** the warning identifies which files/modules lost coverage and by how much
4. **Given** this is the first coverage run (no baseline), **When** CI runs, **Then** current coverage is recorded as the baseline for future comparisons

---

### User Story 3 - Identify Coverage Gaps Automatically (Priority: P3)

Developers can run a command or view a report that identifies the largest coverage gaps in the codebase, ranked by potential impact. The report highlights untested files, modules, or functions that should be prioritized for test addition.

**Why this priority**: While valuable for improving test quality over time, this is less critical than basic coverage tracking and CI integration. It builds on the foundation of P1 and P2.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running the gap analysis command on the current codebase and verifying it produces a ranked list of untested code areas with actionable recommendations.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the codebase has varying coverage levels, **When** gap analysis runs, **Then** a report lists files ranked by lines of untested code
2. **Given** the gap report is generated, **When** developers review it, **Then** each entry shows the file path, current coverage percentage, and number of uncovered lines
3. **Given** multiple files have similar coverage, **When** viewing the gap report, **Then** files are prioritized by code complexity or criticality indicators (e.g., files in core vs. examples)
4. **Given** a developer requests gap analysis for a specific module, **When** the command runs, **Then** the report focuses only on that module's coverage gaps

---

### User Story 4 - Track Quality Metrics Over Time (Priority: P4)

Project maintainers can view historical coverage trends to understand whether test quality is improving or degrading over weeks and months. Trend data is stored and visualized to show coverage evolution across commits, releases, or time periods.

**Why this priority**: Long-term trend analysis is valuable for project health but not essential for day-to-day development. It depends on having P1-P3 working consistently first.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running coverage collection over multiple commits, storing the data, and generating a trend report or visualization showing coverage changes over time.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** coverage data is collected over multiple CI runs, **When** trend analysis is requested, **Then** a report shows coverage percentages plotted over time (by commit or date)
2. **Given** historical coverage data exists, **When** viewing trends, **Then** the report identifies periods of significant coverage increase or decrease
3. **Given** a release is approaching, **When** maintainers review quality metrics, **Then** they can see whether coverage has improved since the last release
4. **Given** coverage data storage is enabled, **When** CI runs complete, **Then** coverage metrics are automatically archived for future trend analysis

### Edge Cases

- What happens when tests fail completely and no coverage data can be collected? (System should handle gracefully without breaking CI)
- How does the system handle coverage for newly added files that have no baseline? (Should mark as new and establish initial baseline)
- What if coverage data becomes corrupted or inaccessible? (Should warn but not fail builds, attempt to regenerate from fresh test run)
- How are files in excluded directories (e.g., `examples/`, `scripts/`) handled? (Should have configurable exclusion patterns, default to testing only `robot_sf/`)
- What happens when the baseline branch (main) has no coverage data? (Initialize baseline from current run, document in CI output)
- How does the system handle parallel test execution? (Coverage data must merge correctly from concurrent test runs)

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

### Key Entities

- **Coverage Report**: Represents a snapshot of test coverage for a single test run, containing overall percentage, per-file percentages, line coverage details, timestamp, and commit identifier
- **Coverage Baseline**: Represents the reference coverage metrics from the main/default branch, used for comparison in PR builds
- **Coverage Gap**: Represents an untested code area, containing file path, uncovered line ranges, coverage percentage, priority score, and recommendation for testing
- **Coverage Trend**: Represents historical coverage data over time, containing series of coverage snapshots, timestamps, commit identifiers, and calculated trend direction (improving/stable/degrading)
- **Module Coverage**: Represents coverage for a specific code module or package, containing module path, coverage percentage, covered/total lines, and relationship to parent package

## Assumptions

- The project uses pytest as the primary testing framework (verified in `pyproject.toml` and existing test tasks)
- Coverage tracking should focus on the `robot_sf/` directory, excluding `tests/`, `test_pygame/`, `examples/`, and `scripts/`
- The CI/CD system has access to filesystem storage for caching coverage baselines between runs
- Developers primarily interact with tests through VS Code tasks or direct `uv run pytest` commands
- A 1% coverage decrease threshold is appropriate for triggering warnings (configurable if needed)
- HTML and JSON report formats are sufficient for most analysis needs beyond terminal output
- The main branch represents the baseline for coverage comparisons
- Coverage trends stored for 100 commits or 90 days provide sufficient historical context
- The project accepts the standard pytest-cov default configuration with project-specific exclusions
- Coverage collection overhead of up to 10% additional test runtime is acceptable for the value provided
