# Figures Naming â€” TODO

- [ ] Implement `--auto-out-dir` in `scripts/generate_figures.py` per design.
- [ ] Write `meta.json` with inputs, commit SHA, schema version, and CLI args.
- [ ] Create/update `docs/figures/_latest.txt` pointing to the canonical folder for the current draft.
- [ ] Update LaTeX include snippets in docs to encourage `_latest.txt` indirection.
- [ ] Migrate existing figures from `docs/figures_long_fix1/` to canonical location; keep old folder for reference until paper freeze.
- [ ] Add pre-commit rule to prevent adding ad-hoc figure folders outside `docs/figures/`.
