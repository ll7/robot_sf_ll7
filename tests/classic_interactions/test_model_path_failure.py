"""Model path failure test (T011 / FR-007).

Purpose (TDD): Assert that when the PPO model path constant points to a non-existent
file, calling run_demo() produces a clear, actionable error message. We *intentionally*
require a guidance phrase that is NOT yet implemented so this test FAILS until task
T021 adds improved messaging.

Expected future behavior (will fail now):
  - Raising FileNotFoundError (or RuntimeError wrapper) containing the missing path
  - Message includes a guidance hint phrase like 'download' or 'pre-trained PPO model'
    so that users know how to resolve it.

Current state: run_demo() will raise FileNotFoundError with a short message lacking
guidance, so the assertion for the guidance phrase will fail (desired TDD failure).
