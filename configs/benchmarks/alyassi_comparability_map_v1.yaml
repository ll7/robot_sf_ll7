  classic_urban_crossing: intersection
  classic_merging: merge
  classic_overtaking: overtaking

  - shared-space micromobility interactions
  - delivery robot curb-side handoff approach
  - mixed sidewalk and bike-lane transitions

metric_comparability:
  success:
    classification: comparable
    alyassi_metric: success_rate
    rationale: Both benchmarks report episode-level success completion.
  collisions:
    classification: comparable
    alyassi_metric: collision_rate
    rationale: Collision rate is directly comparable at episode granularity.
  near_misses:
    classification: proxy
    alyassi_metric: safety-distance violations
    rationale: Near misses approximate low-clearance safety stress but are not identical.
  comfort_exposure:
    classification: proxy
    alyassi_metric: comfort/smoothness terms
    rationale: Comfort exposure overlaps with smoothness-focused safety comfort metrics.
  snqi:
    classification: amv_specific
    alyassi_metric: n/a
    rationale: SNQI is a robot_sf composite quality index used as an AMV extension metric.
