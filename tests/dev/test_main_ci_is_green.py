"""Tests for the main-CI green/red signal used by the red-main merge hold (#5385).

The load-bearing property: an IN-PROGRESS run must never decide green or red —
only the most recent *completed* run does. This is the exact bug that made the
escalation guard silent on 2026-07-11 (it counted an in-progress newest run),
so it gets an explicit test.
