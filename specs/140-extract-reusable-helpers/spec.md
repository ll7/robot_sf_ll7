# Feature Specification: Reusable Helper Consolidation

**Feature Branch**: `140-extract-reusable-helpers`  
**Created**: 2025-09-30  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "extract reusable helpers from examples and scripts into robot_sf"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Repository maintainers need a single, well-documented library surface for demo and script logic so they can update behaviors once in `robot_sf/` and have all examples automatically benefit without duplicating fixes.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** an existing example that previously contained bespoke helper logic, **When** a maintainer reviews the refactored example, **Then** they can trace every non-trivial action to a documented helper in `robot_sf/` without hunting through the example file.
2. **Given** a script author creating a new demo, **When** they search the helper catalog, **Then** they find reusable functions (with descriptions and parameters) that cover previously duplicated behaviors, enabling the script to remain an orchestration wrapper only.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a helper is only used in a single example but is still complex enough to warrant extraction?
- How does the system handle experimental or prototype scripts that intentionally diverge from production-ready helpers?
- How do we prevent CI-only validation scripts from regressing if they remain out of scope for helper extraction?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The platform MUST provide an inventory of reusable helper capabilities currently embedded in examples and scripts, grouped by responsibility (e.g., environment setup, recording, benchmarking helpers).
- **FR-002**: The platform MUST relocate identified reusable logic into the `robot_sf/` library with stable, documented entry points so future updates occur in one place.
- **FR-003**: Examples and scripts MUST delegate non-trivial behavior to the new helpers and avoid maintaining duplicate business logic locally.
- **FR-004**: Documentation MUST explain how to discover and use the new helpers, including links from example READMEs or doc guides back to the library functions.
- **FR-005**: The platform MUST retain behavior parity (existing demos continue to run as before) with regression checks demonstrating that extracted helpers do not change outputs.
- **FR-006**: Scope MUST exclude single-use validation or debugging scripts from the extraction effort while leaving CI automation untouched; only widely used demos/examples are in scope.

### Key Entities
- **Helper Catalog**: Conceptual list of reusable behaviors (environment creation presets, recording utilities, benchmarking wrappers) that must live in `robot_sf/` with documentation and ownership metadata.
- **Example Orchestrator**: Scripts/demos that should only sequence helpers; success is measured by minimal bespoke logic and clear references to the Helper Catalog.

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-30
- Q: Should one-off validation or CI-only scripts be part of this helper-extraction effort? → A: No—limit to widely used demos/examples; leave one-off validation scripts unchanged.
