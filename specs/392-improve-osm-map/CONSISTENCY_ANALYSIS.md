### C. Contradiction Detection

#### **Result: ZERO CONTRADICTIONS FOUND ✅**

**Areas checked**:
- Technology stack consistency (spec vs plan vs research) ✅ All agree: OSMnx, Shapely, GeoPandas, PyProj, Matplotlib, PyYAML
- Tag filtering strategy (spec vs plan vs research) ✅ All agree: footway, path, cycleway, pedestrian; exclude steps, motorway, private access
- Projection approach (spec vs plan vs research) ✅ All agree: Local UTM zone, auto-detected from region center
- Backward-compat approach (spec vs plan vs tasks) ✅ All agree: Optional `allowed_areas` field, defaults to None, zero breakage
- YAML schema structure (plan vs tasks) ✅ All consistent: v1.0, deterministic, world coordinates
- Performance targets (spec vs plan vs tasks) ✅ All consistent: <2s import, <1s render, <100ms editor

**Minor consistency check**:
- Spec mentions "4 phases" → Plan details "Phase 1–4" → Tasks break into "Phase 1–4 with subphases" ✅ Consistent

## Issues & Recommendations

### Critical Issues Found
**Count**: 0 ✅

### High Priority Issues
**Count**: 0 ✅

### Medium Priority Issues

#### Issue M1: data-model.md Not Yet Generated
- **Category**: Documentation Artifact
- **Severity**: MEDIUM (informational; design guidance available in plan.md)
- **Location**: Mentioned in plan.md "Next Steps" but not created
- **Details**: 
  - plan.md section "Module Design & APIs" contains entity definitions (can be extracted to data-model.md)
  - plan.md section "Module Design & APIs" contains MapDefinition changes (can be extracted)
  - Not blocking implementation; entity signatures are precise in tasks
- **Recommendation**: 
  - Generate data-model.md before Phase 1 begins (optional) by extracting from plan.md sections
  - Alternative: Reference plan.md directly during implementation (sufficient for now)

#### Issue M2: quickstart.md Not Yet Generated
- **Category**: Documentation Artifact  
- **Severity**: MEDIUM (user guide deferred to Phase 4)
- **Location**: Mentioned in plan.md but created in Phase 4 (T042)
- **Details**: User workflow documentation is postponed until Phase 1 complete
- **Recommendation**: Expected; create in Phase 4 per schedule

### Low Priority Issues

#### Issue L1: research.md References Not Inline
- **Category**: Documentation
- **Severity**: LOW (reference docs available; not blocking)
- **Location**: research.md folder contains 5 AI proposals; research.md synthesizes but doesn't embed
- **Recommendation**: Acceptable; consolidated research.md sufficient for implementation; retain originals for archive

---

## Next Actions

### Recommended: Proceed to Phase 1 ✅

**Status**: All planning complete. Consistency verified. **Approved for implementation.**

**Before Phase 1 Starts**:
1. ✅ Review tasks.md task list (share with dev team)

3. ✅ Acquire small PBF fixture (test_scenarios/osm_fixtures/) — coordinate with T001
4. ✅ Create branch from `392-Improve-osm-map-generation` for feature development

**Phase 1 Kickoff**:
- Begin with **Task T001**: Create test PBF fixture
- Target: All Phase 1 tasks (T001–T021) complete within 2 weeks
- Parallel tasks marked [P] can be assigned to multiple developers

**Phase 1 Success Criteria**:
- [ ] All T001–T021 tests passing
- [ ] Core importer functional (PBF → MapDef)
- [ ] Background rendering working (PNG + affine transform)
- [ ] Backward-compat validated (pygame, sensors, planners unchanged)
- [ ] Example script (osm_map_quickstart.py) runnable
