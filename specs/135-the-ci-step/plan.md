# Implementation Plan: Optimize CI System Package Installation

**Branch**: `135-the-ci-step` | **Date**: 2025-09-24 | **Spec**: /Users/lennart/git/robot_sf_ll7/specs/135-the-ci-step/spec.md
**Input**: Featu**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - describe approach only)pecification from `/Users/lennart/git/robot_sf_ll7/specs/135-the-ci-step/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Optimize the CI system package installation step to reduce execution time from 2min 26sec to under 1min 13sec (50% reduction) while maintaining package availability and zero installation failures. Acceptable approaches include package caching, faster package managers, pre-built Docker images, and parallel installation within GitHub Actions Ubuntu environment.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: YAML (GitHub Actions workflows), Python 3.13 (repository)  
**Primary Dependencies**: GitHub Actions, Ubuntu system packages (ffmpeg, libglib2.0-0, libgl1, fonts-dejavu-core)  
**Storage**: N/A  
**Testing**: GitHub Actions CI pipeline validation  
**Target Platform**: GitHub Actions Ubuntu runners  
**Project Type**: Single Python project  
**Performance Goals**: Reduce package installation time to under 1min 13sec (50% reduction from 2min 26sec)  
**Constraints**: Must work within GitHub Actions environment, maintain package availability for headless testing, zero installation failures  
**Scale/Scope**: Single CI job optimization affecting all CI runs

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

This feature aligns with Constitution principles:
- **Quality & Performance Targets**: Improves CI reliability and performance, supporting headless execution requirements
- **Development Workflow & Compliance Gates**: Enhances quality gates by reducing CI execution time
- **Scope Discipline**: Focused on development infrastructure optimization within social navigation project scope

No constitutional violations identified. Feature maintains existing contracts and improves development workflow efficiency.

**Structure Decision**: Single project - CI workflow modification (Option 1)

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh copilot`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each contract test file → contract validation task [P]
- Each user story scenario → integration test task
- Each data model entity → monitoring/metrics setup task [P]
- Implementation tasks to modify CI workflow and add optimizations
- Validation tasks to ensure performance targets met

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Contract tests and validation scenarios first
- Dependency order: CI workflow modifications before performance testing
- Parallel execution: Independent tasks marked [P] (contract tests, metrics setup)
- Sequential: CI modifications must be tested incrementally

**Estimated Output**: 12-15 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md
- 3 contract test tasks
- 4 user story validation tasks  
- 2 data model implementation tasks
- 3 CI workflow modification tasks
- 2 performance validation tasks

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
