"""Synthetic slow test report validation (T015).

Validates that the reporting utilities classify and include a deliberately
"slow" sample in the top report output, and that guidance suggestions contain
expected optimization keywords. Uses a short sleep to keep runtime negligible.
Respects ROBOT_SF_PERF_RELAX (no behavioral difference here, but demonstrates
policy integration path).
