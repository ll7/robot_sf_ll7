    Compute the forces exerted on pedestrians by a robot.

    Parameters
    ----------
    out_forces : np.ndarray
        An array where the computed forces will be stored. The array should have the same
        length as `ped_positions`.
    ped_positions : np.ndarray
        An array of the positions of the pedestrians.
    robot_pos : Vec2D
        The position of the robot.
    threshold : float
        The distance threshold for computing the force. If a pedestrian is farther than
        this distance from the robot, the force is not computed.
