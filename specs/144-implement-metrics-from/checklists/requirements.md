# Specification Quality Checklist: Metrics from Paper 2306.16740v4

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: October 22, 2025  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain (all 2 markers resolved - see Clarifications section in spec.md)
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

### Clarifications Resolved

Both [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers have been resolved and documented in the spec.md Clarifications section:

1. **FR-001**: Specific metrics from Table 1 of paper 2306.16740v4 now fully documented with 11 NHT metrics and 11 SHT metrics including parameters, units, ranges
2. **User Story 3**: Output format clarified - use existing `episode.schema.v1.json` format with metric names as keys

### Validation Status

- Content Quality: ✅ PASS
- All Requirement Completeness items: ✅ PASS
- Feature Readiness: ✅ PASS
- Clarifications: ✅ COMPLETE

### Recommendation

✅ **READY FOR PLANNING** - All clarifications resolved. Specification is complete and ready for implementation planning phase. Proceed with creating the implementation plan following speckit workflow.
