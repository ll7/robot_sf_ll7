# Feature Specification: Fix Benchmark Placeholder Outputs

**Feature Branch**: `133-all-generated-plots`
**Created**: September 24, 2025
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "All generated plots from #file:classic_benchmark_full.py are only place holders as can be seen in results/full_classic_run_01/plots also the video is only a dummy video in results/full_classic_run_01/videos. I guess the benchmark is not working properly. Why and how do I fix this. Get inspiraton from configs/scenarios/classic_interactions.yaml examples/demo_full_classic_benchmark.py For the video you should use the methods from #file:environment_factory.py and #file:sim_view.py to render the videos. For the pdf plots, probably the #file:benchmark metrics are not implemented properly #file:metrics . Also consider looking at #file:docs for not applied changes as well as #file:specs from the latest updates."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Problem: Benchmark produces placeholder plots and dummy videos instead of real outputs
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: Benchmark system, developers
   ‚Üí Actions: Generate plots, render videos, compute metrics
   ‚Üí Data: Episode data, scenario configurations, metrics
   ‚Üí Constraints: Must use proper rendering methods, metrics must be implemented
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Clear user flow: Run benchmark ‚Üí Get real plots and videos
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a researcher running the full classic interaction benchmark, I want the system to generate real plots and videos showing actual benchmark results instead of placeholder graphics, so that I can properly analyze and visualize the performance of navigation algorithms.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a completed benchmark run with episode data, **When** I check the plots directory, **Then** I should see actual PDF plots showing real metric distributions, trajectories, and performance data instead of placeholder images
2. **Given** a completed benchmark run with episode data, **When** I check the videos directory, **Then** I should see actual rendered videos showing robot navigation scenarios instead of dummy placeholder videos
3. **Given** benchmark execution with valid scenario configurations, **When** the system computes metrics, **Then** it should use properly implemented metric calculations instead of placeholder values

### Edge Cases
- What happens when video rendering dependencies (MoviePy, matplotlib) are not available? **SPECIFIED**: System MUST provide clear error messages and continue benchmark execution with warnings, generating placeholder outputs if possible
- How does system handle scenarios with insufficient data for meaningful plots? **SPECIFIED**: System MUST validate data completeness and provide warnings for insufficient data, generating available plots with clear data limitations noted
- What happens when metric computation fails for specific episodes? **SPECIFIED**: System MUST log specific failures and continue processing valid episodes, providing partial results with failure summaries

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST generate actual PDF plots showing real benchmark metrics and distributions instead of placeholder graphics (DEFINITION: Plots containing computed statistical data from episode metrics, not hardcoded placeholder images)
- **FR-002**: System MUST render actual videos of robot navigation scenarios using proper simulation replay instead of dummy placeholder videos (DEFINITION: Videos showing robot trajectories and pedestrian interactions, either through simulation replay or data-driven animation, not static dummy footage)
- **FR-003**: System MUST compute and use properly implemented benchmark metrics for all plot and video generation
- **FR-004**: System MUST validate that generated plots and videos contain real data before marking benchmark as complete
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide clear error messages when plot/video generation fails due to missing dependencies or data issues

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Episode Data**: Raw simulation data from benchmark runs including robot trajectories, pedestrian positions, and interaction metrics
- **Scenario Configuration**: YAML files defining benchmark scenarios with parameters for different interaction types
- **Benchmark Metrics**: Computed performance measures including collision rates, success rates, and navigation efficiency scores
- **Visual Artifacts**: Generated plots (PDF) and videos showing benchmark results and simulation replays
