# Analysis Report: Feature 144 - Paper Metrics Implementation

**Generated**: 2025-01-15  
**Feature Branch**: `144-implement-metrics-from`  
**Analysis Phase**: Pre-implementation validation per speckit.analyze.prompt.md

---

## Executive Summary

✅ **Overall Status**: READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION (with minor corrections)

The feature specification, planning, and task breakdown are well-structured and comprehensive. Analysis identified **5 issues** requiring attention before implementation begins:

- **3 MEDIUM severity**: Specification errors (metric count, units)
- **2 LOW severity**: Minor inconsistencies and coverage gaps

**Recommendation**: Fix the 3 MEDIUM issues in spec.md (5-minute corrections), then proceed with implementation. The LOW issues can be addressed during implementation.

---

## Findings Summary

| ID | Severity | Category | Description | Location | Remediation |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| F001 | MEDIUM | Specification Error | SHT metric count mismatch: spec claims "11 metrics" but lists 14 | spec.md line ~119 | Change "11 metrics" to "14 metrics" |
| F002 | MEDIUM | Units Error | TTC metric units listed as "meters" should be "seconds" | spec.md line ~108 | Change "(meters, [0,∞))" to "(seconds, [0,∞))" |
| F003 | MEDIUM | Units Error | SC metric units listed as "meters" should be "unitless ratio" | spec.md line ~107 | Change "(meters, [0,1])" to "(unitless, [0,1])" |
| F004 | LOW | Naming Inconsistency | spec uses "Success (S)" but tasks use "success_rate" | spec.md vs tasks.md | Document in implementation that S is boolean, SR (success_rate) is aggregate |
| F005 | LOW | Coverage Gap | FR-009 (clear error messages) has no explicit test task | spec.md, tasks.md | Add error message validation to T027 or create new task |

---

## Detailed Analysis

### 1. Duplications

**Status**: ✅ NO CRITICAL DUPLICATIONS FOUND

- Metric definitions appear once in spec.md
- Task breakdown (T003-T021) maps 1:1 to each metric/metric-group
- Helper function definitions (_compute_ped_velocities, _compute_jerk) documented once in research.md
- Acceptance criteria unique per user story

**Minor observation**: Some repetition of edge case descriptions across spec.md, research.md, and data-model.md is intentional for completeness in each artifact.

---

### 2. Ambiguities

**Status**: ✅ NO CRITICAL AMBIGUITIES REMAIN

All clarification markers resolved:
- `[CLARIFICATION NEEDED: metric-list]` → RESOLVED with full 22-metric table
- `[CLARIFICATION NEEDED: schema-format]` → RESOLVED as episode.schema.v1.json flat keys

**Edge cases well-defined** in research.md:
- Zero pedestrians → most SHT metrics return NaN
- Single timestep → velocity=0, acceleration/jerk=NaN
- Missing data → graceful degradation with NaN

**Minor**: Some formulas reference "trajectory" without explicit definition of sampling rate, but research.md clarifies this as per-timestep from episode data.

---

### 3. Underspecification

**Status**: ⚠️ ONE MINOR GAP IDENTIFIED (F005)

**FR-009 coverage gap**:
- Requirement: "System MUST provide clear error messages when required data is missing or invalid"
- Current tasks: T027 (validation tests) mentions "No exceptions raised" but doesn't explicitly test error message *content*
- **Recommendation**: Add explicit test case in T027 or T022 to validate error message clarity

**Well-specified areas**:
- All 22 metrics have full function signatures in contracts/metric_signatures.md
- Edge case behavior documented in data-model.md with NaN/0.0 decision table
- Performance targets clear: <100ms per episode, <30s for 1000 episodes
- Schema validation explicit in T029-T030

---

### 4. Constitution Alignment

**Status**: ✅ ALIGNED (10/12 principles, 2 marked for attention)

Plan.md already documents constitution check:

**Passing (10/12)**:
- Principle I (Clarity) ✅
- Principle II (Modularity) ✅
- Principle III (Testability) ✅
- Principle IV (Performance) ✅
- Principle V (Backward Compatibility) ✅
- Principle VI (Documentation) ✅
- Principle VII (Semantic Versioning) ✅
- Principle VIII (Code Style) ✅
- Principle X (Error Handling) ✅
- Principle XI (JSON Schema) ✅

**Marked for attention (2/12)**:
- Principle IX (Determinism) ⚠️ - Requires validation that metric computation order doesn't affect results (addressed in T027)
- Principle XII (Logging) ⚠️ - Need to ensure metrics use Loguru not print() (addressed in FR-009 and T001)

**No new violations detected** in this analysis. The 2 attention items are appropriately tracked.

---

### 5. Inconsistencies

**Finding F001 - SHT Metric Count Mismatch** (MEDIUM):
- **spec.md line ~119** states "11 SHT metrics"
- **Actual count**: 14 metrics (V_min/avg/max=3, A_min/avg/max=3, J_min/avg/max=3, CD_min/avg=2, SC=1, DH_min=1, TTC=1, AT=1)
- **Impact**: Confusion during implementation
- **Fix**: Change spec.md to say "14 SHT metrics"

**Finding F002 - TTC Units Error** (MEDIUM):
- **spec.md line ~108**: "Minimum time to collision (TTC): Time duration (meters, [0,∞))"
- **Correct units**: seconds (it's a *time* to collision)
- **Impact**: Implementation may use wrong units
- **Fix**: Change to "(seconds, [0,∞))"

**Finding F003 - SC Units Error** (MEDIUM):
- **spec.md line ~107**: "Space compliance (SC): Ratio metric (meters, [0,1])"
- **Correct units**: unitless (it's a ratio/percentage)
- **Impact**: Implementation may apply wrong unit conversions
- **Fix**: Change to "(unitless, [0,1])"

**Finding F004 - Success Naming** (LOW):
- **spec.md**: "Success (S)" is defined as boolean
- **tasks.md**: T003 title uses "success_rate"
- **Not a bug**: S is per-episode boolean, SR (Success Rate) is aggregate average
- **Recommendation**: Add note in T003 implementation to clarify S vs SR distinction

---

### 6. Specification Errors (Summary from above)

Three specification errors found (F001, F002, F003) - all straightforward to fix:

1. **Metric count**: Change "11 SHT metrics" → "14 SHT metrics"
2. **TTC units**: Change "(meters, [0,∞))" → "(seconds, [0,∞))"
3. **SC units**: Change "(meters, [0,1])" → "(unitless, [0,1])"

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Performance targets not met (< 100ms) | LOW | MEDIUM | T033 validates early; NumPy vectorization in design |
| Edge cases break metrics | LOW | HIGH | Comprehensive T027 validation suite |
| Schema compatibility issues | LOW | HIGH | T029-T030 explicit validation against episode.schema.v1.json |
| Missing optional data (obstacles) | MEDIUM | LOW | Research.md defines graceful degradation |

### Process Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Specification errors cause rework | MEDIUM (now LOW after fixing F001-F003) | MEDIUM | Fix spec errors before implementation |
| Task dependencies block progress | LOW | MEDIUM | 18 tasks marked [P] for parallelization |
| Integration breaks existing code | LOW | HIGH | T032 smoke tests existing functionality |

## Recommendations

### Critical Actions (Before Implementation)

1. **Fix F001**: Edit spec.md line ~119 to change "11 SHT metrics" → "14 SHT metrics"
2. **Fix F002**: Edit spec.md line ~108 to change TTC units "(meters, [0,∞))" → "(seconds, [0,∞))"
3. **Fix F003**: Edit spec.md line ~107 to change SC units "(meters, [0,1])" → "(unitless, [0,1])"

Estimated time: **5 minutes**

### Recommended Actions (During Implementation)

4. **Address F004**: In T003 implementation, add docstring note clarifying S (boolean per-episode) vs SR (success_rate aggregate)
5. **Address F005**: In T027, add explicit test case validating error message content when required data missing (test FR-009)

Estimated time: **15 minutes during normal implementation**

### Optional Enhancements (Not blocking)

- Add performance profiling to identify bottleneck metrics (support T033)
- Create visual diagram of metric computation flow (enhance documentation)
- Add example notebook demonstrating all 22 metrics on synthetic data
