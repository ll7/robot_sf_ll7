# Specification Quality Checklist: Single Pedestrian Spawning and Control

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: October 17, 2025  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

**Validation Iteration 1** (October 17, 2025):

All checklist items pass. The specification:
- Contains no implementation-specific details (focuses on WHAT, not HOW)
- Defines measurable, technology-agnostic success criteria
- Provides 5 prioritized user stories with independent test scenarios
- Identifies 8 edge cases
- Lists 15 functional requirements that are testable
- Clearly bounds scope (in/out of scope sections)
- Documents assumptions, dependencies, and risks
- Contains no [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers (all decisions made using reasonable defaults)

**Status**: âœ… READY FOR PLANNING

The specification is complete and ready to proceed to `/speckit.clarify` (if needed) or `/speckit.plan`.
