def sample_zone(zone: Zone, num_samples: int) -> list[Vec2D]:
    """
    Generate a specified number of random sample points within a zone.

    The zone is defined as a triangle with vertices a, b, and c. The points are generated
    using uniform random sampling.

    Parameters
    ----------
    zone : Zone
        The zone within which to generate sample points. This is a tuple of three 2D
        vectors representing the vertices of the triangle.
    num_samples : int
        The number of sample points to generate.

    Returns
    -------
    List[Vec2D]
        A list of the generated sample points. Each point is a tuple of two numbers
        representing the x and y coordinates.
