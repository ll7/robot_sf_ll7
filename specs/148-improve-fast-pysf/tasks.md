# Tasks: Improve fast-pysf Integration

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/148-improve-fast-pysf/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md ‚úÖ, spec.md ‚úÖ, research.md ‚úÖ, data-model.md ‚úÖ, contracts/ ‚úÖ

**Tests**: Not explicitly requested in spec - tasks focus on integration, quality tooling, and PR review resolution

**Organization**: Tasks grouped by user story priority (P1 ‚Üí P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3) to enable independent implementation and testing

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (US1, US2, US3, US4)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- Repository root: `/Users/lennart/git/robot_sf_ll7/`
- Main tests: `tests/`
- fast-pysf tests: `fast-pysf/tests/`
- Configuration: `pyproject.toml`
- Documentation: `docs/`

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Verify baseline and prepare for test integration

- [ ] T001 [P] Verify current test baseline: Run `uv run pytest tests -v` and confirm ~43 tests pass
- [ ] T002 [P] Verify fast-pysf tests can run independently: `uv run pytest fast-pysf/tests -v` (expect 10 pass, 2 fail)
- [ ] T003 [P] Document baseline metrics in `specs/148-improve-fast-pysf/baseline_metrics.md`:
  - robot_sf test count: ~43
  - fast-pysf test count: 12 (10 pass, 2 fail)
  - Current coverage: ~91.73% for robot_sf
  - ruff status: passes for robot_sf only
  - ty status: warnings for robot_sf only

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Create test fixtures and update configuration - MUST complete before user stories

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [ ] T004 Create test fixture directory: `mkdir -p fast-pysf/tests/test_maps/`
- [ ] T005 [P] Create valid map fixture in `fast-pysf/tests/test_maps/map_regular.json`:
  ```json
  {
    "obstacles": [[5.0, 5.0], [10.0, 10.0], [15.0, 5.0]],
    "routes": [{"id": "route1", "waypoints": [[0.0, 0.0], [20.0, 20.0]]}],
    "crowded_zones": [{"center": [10.0, 10.0], "radius": 5.0}]
  }
  ```
- [ ] T006 [P] Create invalid map fixture in `fast-pysf/tests/test_maps/invalid_json_file.json`:
  ```json
  {
    "obstacles": "not_an_array",
    "routes": [1, 2, 3]
  }
  ```
- [ ] T007 Verify fixtures resolve test failures: `uv run pytest fast-pysf/tests/test_map_loader.py -v` (expect all pass)

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - all 12 fast-pysf tests should pass, user story implementation can begin

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Seamless Test Execution (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Goal**: Enable unified test execution with single `uv run pytest` command for both robot_sf and fast-pysf tests

**Independent Test**: Run `uv run pytest` from repository root and verify both test suites execute (55+ tests total)

### Configuration Tasks

### Verification Tasks

- [ ] T010 [US1] Test unified execution: `uv run pytest -v` (expect 55+ tests, all pass)
- [ ] T011 [US1] Test selective execution: `uv run pytest tests -v` (expect ~43 tests, robot_sf only)
- [ ] T012 [US1] Test fast-pysf only: `uv run pytest fast-pysf/tests -v` (expect 12 tests)
- [ ] T013 [US1] Test headless mode: `DISPLAY= MPLBACKEND=Agg SDL_VIDEODRIVER=dummy uv run pytest -v`
- [ ] T014 [US1] Test parallel execution: `uv run pytest -n auto -v` (expect same results, faster)
- [ ] T015 [US1] Verify coverage includes fast-pysf: Check `coverage.json` for `fast-pysf/pysocialforce/` entries

### Documentation Tasks

- [ ] T016 [P] [US1] Update `docs/dev_guide.md` testing section:
  - Add "Unified Test Suite" subsection under "Testing strategy"
  - Document `uv run pytest` runs both robot_sf and fast-pysf tests
  - Update test count from ~43 to 55+
  - Add example: "Run only fast-pysf tests: `uv run pytest fast-pysf/tests`"

    "fast-pysf/**/*.py" = [
        "C901",    # Complex function (relax initially)
        "PLR0912", # Too many branches
        "PLR0913", # Too many arguments
        "PLR0915", # Too many statements
    ]
    ```

## Phase 6: User Story 4 - Improved Type Annotations (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Add type annotations to fast-pysf public APIs and reduce `Any` usage by 25%

**Independent Test**: Compare type error count before/after and verify 25% reduction in undefined/Any types

### Baseline and Planning

- [ ] T055 [US4] Analyze current type annotation state:
  - Run: `uvx ty check fast-pysf/pysocialforce --exit-zero > specs/148-improve-fast-pysf/type_errors_before.txt`
  - Count total type errors
  - Identify files with most `Any` types
  - Prioritize public API functions

- [ ] T056 [US4] Create annotation plan in `specs/148-improve-fast-pysf/annotation_plan.md`:
  - List target functions (public APIs first)

  - Estimate effort per file
  - Set success metric: 25% reduction in undefined types

### Public API Annotations

- [ ] T057 [P] [US4] Add type hints to `fast-pysf/pysocialforce/forces.py` public functions:
  - Functions: `desired_force`, `social_force`, `obstacle_force`, `ortho_vec`

  - Annotate initialization parameters
  - Type pedestrian and obstacle lists
  - Use protocols for duck-typed interfaces if needed

### Replace Any Types

- [ ] T061 [US4] Identify and replace `Any` types:
  - Search for `Any` imports and usage
  - Replace with specific types where possible
  - Use `Protocol` for duck-typed interfaces
  - Use `TypeVar` for generic functions
  - Document remaining `Any` usage with rationale

### Verification

- [ ] T062 [US4] Verify type annotations:
  - Run: `uvx ty check fast-pysf/pysocialforce --exit-zero > specs/148-improve-fast-pysf/type_errors_after.txt`
  - Compare error counts (should reduce by ‚â•25%)
  - Verify no new runtime errors: `uv run pytest fast-pysf/tests -v`

- [ ] T063 [US4] Verify numba compatibility:
  - Run tests with numba functions: `uv run pytest fast-pysf/tests/test_forces.py -v`
  - Check for numba compilation warnings
  - Ensure JIT-compiled functions still work

### Documentation

### Parallel Opportunities

**Within Setup (Phase 1)**: All tasks can run in parallel
- T001 (verify robot_sf tests) || T002 (verify fast-pysf tests) || T003 (document baseline)

**Within Foundational (Phase 2)**: T005 and T006 can run in parallel
- T005 (create valid fixture) || T006 (create invalid fixture)

**Within US1 (Phase 3)**: Documentation tasks can run in parallel
- T016 (update dev_guide.md) || T017 (update README.md) || T018 (create fixture README)

**Within US2 (Phase 4)**: Most fix tasks can run in parallel (different files)
- All T019-T042 marked [P] can run concurrently (23 parallel tasks!)

**Within US3 (Phase 5)**: Documentation tasks can run in parallel
- T053 (update dev_guide) || T054 (create quality standards doc)

**Within US4 (Phase 6)**: Annotation tasks can run in parallel (different files)
- T057 (forces.py) || T058 (simulator.py) || T059 (map_loader.py) || T060 (scene.py)

**Within Polish (Phase 7)**: Most documentation tasks can run in parallel
- T066 (CHANGELOG) || T067 (dev_guide) || T068 (migration guide)

**Cross-Story Parallelism** (if team capacity allows):
- US1 and US2 are independent - can work in parallel after Foundational complete
- Different developers can work on different stories simultaneously

## Implementation Strategy

**Approach**: Incremental delivery with independent testing per user story

**Phase 1 (MVP)**: Focus on User Story 1 only
- Delivers immediate value: unified test execution
- Independently testable: `uv run pytest` works
- Low risk: configuration changes only
- Quick win: ~7 hours to completion

**Phase 2 (Quality)**: Address User Story 2 in parallel with US1 deployment
- Can start before US1 is fully documented
- Independent of test integration
- High parallel potential: 23 tasks marked [P]

**Phase 3 (Standards)**: Build on US1, add quality tooling
- Requires test integration foundation
- Natural extension of existing quality gates
- Medium effort: ~3-4 hours

**Phase 4 (Enhancement)**: Optional type annotation improvements
- Lowest priority: P3
- Can be deferred or done incrementally
- Enhances developer experience but not critical

**Deployment Gates**:
- After US1: Unified tests must pass (SC-001, SC-002, SC-003)
- After US2: All high-priority review comments resolved (SC-004, SC-005)
- After US3: Quality gates unified and fast (SC-006, SC-008, SC-013)
- After US4: Type errors reduced ‚â•25% (SC-007)

**Rollback Strategy**:
- US1: Revert pyproject.toml changes
- US2: Review comments tracked, partial resolution acceptable
- US3: Per-file ignores allow gradual adoption
- US4: Type annotations are additive, can be reverted per-file
