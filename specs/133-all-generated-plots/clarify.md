# Clarification Results: Fix Benchmark Placeholder Outputs

**Feature Branch**: `133-all-generated-plots`
**Status**: âœ… COMPLETE - No critical ambiguities found
**Analysis Date**: Current session

## Executive Summary

After comprehensive analysis of the feature specification, **no critical ambiguities requiring clarification were identified**. The specification is well-structured with:

- âœ… Clear success criteria and acceptance scenarios
- âœ… Well-defined edge cases with specified behaviors
- âœ… Testable functional requirements
- âœ… Explicit definitions for key terms ("real plots", "actual videos")
- âœ… Comprehensive error handling specifications

## Coverage Analysis Results

### Taxonomy Coverage Assessment

| Category | Status | Details |
|----------|--------|---------|
| **User Types** | âœ… Complete | Researcher running benchmarks |
| **Data Handling** | âœ… Complete | Episode data, metrics, configurations clearly defined |
| **Performance** | âœ… Complete | No specific performance targets needed for this visualization feature |
| **Scale/Scope** | âœ… Complete | Bounded to benchmark output generation |
| **Error Handling** | âœ… Complete | Specified behaviors for missing dependencies, insufficient data, metric failures |
| **Integration** | âœ… Complete | Clear integration points with benchmark system |
| **Security** | âœ… Complete | No security concerns for visualization feature |

### Ambiguity Scan Results

**No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers found in specification.**

**Structured Analysis:**
- **Requirements Clarity**: All functional requirements are testable and unambiguous
- **Success Criteria**: Measurable outcomes clearly defined (real plots vs placeholders, actual videos vs dummies)
- **Edge Cases**: Comprehensive coverage with specified behaviors
- **Dependencies**: Clear identification of required components (MoviePy, matplotlib, metrics implementation)

## Conclusion

**ðŸŽ¯ RESULT: Specification is production-ready**

The feature specification for fixing benchmark placeholder outputs is sufficiently detailed and unambiguous for implementation. All critical aspects are addressed:

- Problem definition is clear
- Success criteria are measurable
- Edge cases are handled
- Requirements are testable
- Integration points are defined

**Recommendation**: Proceed with implementation using the existing specification. No clarification questions needed.
