# Requirements Quality Checklist: Single Pedestrian Spawning and Control

**Purpose**: Validate the quality, clarity, and completeness of requirements for single pedestrian spawning and control
**Created**: October 17, 2025
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Requirement Completeness
- [x] CHK001 - Are all necessary requirements for single pedestrian spawning, goal navigation, and trajectory following explicitly documented? [Completeness, Spec §Functional Requirements] - YES: FR-001 through FR-015 cover spawning (FR-002), goal navigation (FR-003), and trajectory following (FR-004, FR-005)
- [x] CHK002 - Are requirements for error handling and edge cases (e.g., invalid coordinates, duplicate IDs, overlapping agents) specified? [Completeness, Spec §Edge Cases] - YES: FR-011, FR-012 for validation, §Edge Cases covers 8 scenarios including duplicate IDs, overlapping agents, invalid goals
- [x] CHK003 - Are requirements for visualization of pedestrian elements (starts, goals, trajectories) included? [Completeness, Spec §User Story 4] - YES: FR-009 explicitly requires visualization, User Story 4 has 3 acceptance scenarios for visual elements

## Requirement Clarity
- [x] CHK004 - Are terms like "goal", "trajectory", "start position" clearly defined and unambiguous? [Clarity, Spec §Key Entities] - YES: §Key Entities defines SinglePedestrianDefinition with clear descriptions, "goal position" and "trajectory (list of waypoint coordinates)" are explicitly defined
- [x] CHK005 - Are requirements for mutually exclusive goal/trajectory behavior unambiguous? [Clarity, Spec §Functional Requirements] - YES: FR-004 and FR-005 clearly state trajectory-based pedestrians do not apply goal-seeking forces, §Key Entities states "either a goal position or a trajectory (mutually exclusive)"
- [x] CHK006 - Are validation and error messaging requirements specific and clear? [Clarity, Spec §Functional Requirements] - YES: FR-011 specifies validation requirements (ID uniqueness, valid coordinates, mutual exclusivity), FR-012 requires "clear error messages", SC-005 measures 100% actionable error messages

## Requirement Consistency
- [x] CHK007 - Are requirements for single and multi-pedestrian scenarios consistent across all user stories? [Consistency, Spec §User Story 5] - YES: User Story 1-4 establish single pedestrian behavior, User Story 5 extends to multiple (up to 4) with consistent configuration approach, FR-013 and FR-014 ensure multi-pedestrian support maintains same interaction rules
- [x] CHK008 - Are requirements for integration with existing map and robot behavior consistent with backward compatibility goals? [Consistency, Spec §Functional Requirements] - YES: FR-010 explicitly requires "no breaking changes", SC-007 measures backward compatibility with 100% existing maps functioning, §Scope confirms existing SVG parser infrastructure reuse

## Acceptance Criteria Quality
- [x] CHK009 - Are success criteria measurable and technology-agnostic (e.g., configuration time, navigation accuracy, visual clarity)? [Acceptance Criteria, Spec §Measurable Outcomes] - YES: SC-001 through SC-008 are all measurable (time: <2 min, accuracy: <0.5m, percentages: 90%, 100%, performance: <10% increase, reproducibility: bit-identical across 10 runs) and technology-agnostic
- [x] CHK010 - Are acceptance scenarios for each user story independently testable? [Acceptance Criteria, Spec §User Scenarios & Testing] - YES: Each user story includes "Independent Test" section explaining how it can be tested standalone, acceptance scenarios use Given-When-Then format with clear testable conditions

## Scenario Coverage
- [x] CHK011 - Are requirements defined for all primary, alternate, and exception scenarios (e.g., static pedestrians, unreachable goals, trajectory through obstacles)? [Coverage, Spec §Edge Cases] - YES: §Edge Cases covers 8 scenarios including static pedestrians (no goal/trajectory), unreachable goals (goal inside obstacle), trajectory through obstacles, overlapping agents, empty trajectories, duplicate IDs
- [x] CHK012 - Are requirements for multiple single pedestrians and their interactions with other agents covered? [Coverage, Spec §User Story 5] - YES: User Story 5 has 3 acceptance scenarios for multiple pedestrians, FR-013 requires support for at least 4, FR-014 requires Social Force interactions between all agents

## Edge Case Coverage
- [x] CHK013 - Are boundary conditions and negative scenarios (e.g., empty trajectory, overlapping start positions) addressed in requirements? [Edge Case, Spec §Edge Cases] - YES: §Edge Cases explicitly covers empty trajectory list, overlapping start positions, goals inside obstacles, trajectories through impassable terrain, waypoint spacing extremes, no goal/trajectory specified

## Non-Functional Requirements
- [x] CHK014 - Are performance requirements (≤10% per-step simulation time increase) specified and measurable? [Non-Functional, Spec §Measurable Outcomes] - YES: SC-004 explicitly states "adding up to 4 single pedestrians does not increase per-step simulation time by more than 10%", measurable with profiling
- [x] CHK015 - Are reproducibility and deterministic behavior requirements documented? [Non-Functional, Spec §Measurable Outcomes] - YES: FR-015 requires deterministic behavior for given random seed, SC-006 measures bit-identical trajectories across 10 consecutive runs with same seed
- [x] CHK016 - Are documentation and usability requirements (e.g., example scripts, docs updates) included? [Non-Functional, Spec §Success Criteria] - YES: SC-001 measures configuration time (<2 min), SC-008 requires documentation completeness verified by 3 independent researchers, §In Scope includes "Documentation updates and working examples (1-4 pedestrian scenarios)"

## Dependencies & Assumptions
- [x] CHK017 - Are all dependencies (PySocialForce, map parser, visualization) and key assumptions documented and validated? [Dependencies, Spec §Dependencies & Assumptions] - YES: §Dependencies lists PySocialForce, SVG parser, Pygame rendering, MapDefinition, Simulator with specific file paths. §Assumptions documents 8 key assumptions including PySocialForce integration, SVG extensibility, rendering capacity, Social Force Model appropriateness

## Ambiguities & Conflicts
- [x] CHK018 - Are all ambiguous terms, potential conflicts, and open questions resolved or explicitly documented? [Ambiguity, Spec §Open Questions] - YES: §Open Questions states "None at this time. All requirements have been specified with reasonable defaults based on existing architecture patterns", §Edge Cases addresses potential ambiguities with explicit decisions
