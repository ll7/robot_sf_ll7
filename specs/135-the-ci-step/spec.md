# Feature Specification: Optimize CI System Package Installation

**Feature Branch**: `135-the-ci-step`
**Created**: September 24, 2025
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "the CI Step "System packages for headless" is too slow. CI takes 5 minutes and this job requires 2min and 26 seconds. Find ways to reduce the execution time of this step."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí CI performance optimization request identified
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: CI system, system package installation, performance bottleneck
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí CI performance optimization scenarios defined
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-24
- Q: What is the target time reduction for the "System packages for headless" CI step? ‚Üí A: Achieve 50% time reduction (target under 1min 13sec)
- Q: What optimization approaches are acceptable or preferred for reducing the package installation time? ‚Üí A: A, B, C, D (package caching, faster package managers, pre-built images, parallel installation)
- Q: What is the acceptable failure rate for system package installation in CI? ‚Üí A: Zero failures - installation must always succeed
- Q: How will "measurable time savings" be defined and measured for the optimization? ‚Üí A: Consistent achievement of target time (under 1min 13sec)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer, I want CI builds to complete faster so that I can get feedback on code changes more quickly and spend less time waiting for CI results.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a CI pipeline that currently takes 5 minutes, **When** the system package installation step is optimized, **Then** the total CI time should be reduced by achieving 50% time reduction for the package installation step (under 1min 13sec)
2. **Given** headless system dependencies are required for testing, **When** system packages are installed, **Then** all required packages (ffmpeg, libglib2.0-0, libgl1, fonts-dejavu-core) must be available for the test suite
3. **Given** a CI job that installs system packages, **When** the installation method is changed, **Then** the headless functionality must remain intact

### Edge Cases
- What happens when package repositories are slow or unavailable?
- How does the system handle different Ubuntu versions in CI?
- What if some packages become unavailable or change names?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST reduce the execution time of the "System packages for headless" CI step to under 1min 13sec (50% reduction from current 2min 26sec)
- **FR-002**: System MUST ensure all required headless packages (ffmpeg, libglib2.0-0, libgl1, fonts-dejavu-core) remain available after optimization
- **FR-003**: System MUST maintain headless testing capability for GUI-dependent components
- **FR-004**: System MUST preserve CI reliability and not introduce package installation failures
- **FR-005**: System MUST consistently achieve the target installation time of under 1min 13sec

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: Package installation step MUST complete in under 1min 13sec (50% reduction target)
- **NFR-002**: CI pipeline reliability MUST not decrease - package installation failures must remain at zero

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **CI Job**: Represents a single CI pipeline execution with timing metrics
- **System Package**: Represents a required Ubuntu package with installation metadata
- **Performance Metric**: Tracks execution time and identifies bottlenecks

### Constraints & Assumptions
- **CA-001**: Acceptable optimization approaches include package caching, faster package managers, pre-built Docker images, and parallel installation
- **CA-002**: Solution must work within GitHub Actions Ubuntu environment
- **CA-003**: Must maintain compatibility with existing CI workflow and package requirements
