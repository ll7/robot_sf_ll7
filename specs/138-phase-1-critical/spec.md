# Feature Specification: Type Checking Fixes

**Feature Branch**: `138-phase-1-critical`  
**Created**: September 26, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Phase 1 - Critical Fixes (High Priority): Fix datetime.UTC imports for Python version compatibility Address missing required arguments in factory functions Fix invalid type assignments that could cause runtime errors Phase 2 - Type Annotations (Medium Priority): Update return type annotations for environment factories Fix parameter defaults in data analysis functions Resolve Gym space type issues Phase 3 - Import Resolution (Low Priority): Add conditional imports for optional dependencies Fix dynamic import type issues Resolve test utility type problems Phase 4 - Code Quality (Ongoing): Add missing type annotations Improve generic type usage Enhance type safety in utility functions"

## Clarifications
### Session 2025-09-26
- Q: What Python versions are supported for datetime.UTC compatibility? ‚Üí A: Python 3.11 and later (latest stable features)
- Q: Are breaking changes to public APIs allowed when fixing type issues? ‚Üí A: No breaking changes allowed - maintain backward compatibility
- Q: What type checker is being used for validation? ‚Üí A: uvx ty (mypy-based, used in uv toolchain)
- Q: How should optional dependencies be handled in Phase 3? ‚Üí A: Keep them optional with conditional imports
- Q: What is the target type coverage percentage after all fixes are complete? ‚Üí A: 80%

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: type checking, Python compatibility, factory functions, type annotations, import resolution, code quality
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer working on the robot_sf codebase, I want to resolve type checking diagnostics so that the code has better type safety, fewer potential runtime errors, and improved maintainability.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the codebase has 103 type checking diagnostics, **When** I implement Phase 1 critical fixes, **Then** the most critical type errors related to Python compatibility and runtime safety are resolved
2. **Given** environment factory functions have type annotation issues, **When** I update return type annotations in Phase 2, **Then** type checkers correctly understand the return types of factory functions
3. **Given** optional dependencies cause import resolution issues, **When** I add conditional imports in Phase 3, **Then** the code works correctly with or without optional dependencies
4. **Given** utility functions lack type annotations, **When** I enhance type safety in Phase 4, **Then** the codebase has comprehensive type coverage and better IDE support

### Edge Cases
- Type fixes must be implemented without breaking public APIs (backward compatibility required)
- How does the system handle optional dependencies that are not installed?
- What if some type fixes conflict with existing code patterns?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST fix datetime.UTC imports to ensure Python version compatibility across Python 3.11 and later
- **FR-002**: System MUST address missing required arguments in factory functions to prevent runtime errors
- **FR-003**: System MUST fix invalid type assignments that could cause runtime type errors
- **FR-004**: System MUST update return type annotations for environment factories to provide accurate type information
- **FR-005**: System MUST fix parameter defaults in data analysis functions to match expected types
- **FR-006**: System MUST resolve Gym space type issues for proper reinforcement learning integration
- **FR-007**: System MUST add conditional imports for optional dependencies to handle missing packages gracefully while keeping them optional
- **FR-008**: System MUST fix dynamic import type issues to ensure type safety in import operations
- **FR-009**: System MUST resolve test utility type problems to maintain reliable testing infrastructure
- **FR-010**: System MUST add missing type annotations throughout the codebase for better type checking coverage
- **FR-011**: System MUST improve generic type usage to leverage Python's type system effectively
- **FR-012**: System MUST enhance type safety in utility functions to prevent type-related bugs
- **FR-013**: System MUST maintain backward compatibility and avoid breaking changes to public APIs
- **FR-014**: System MUST ensure type fixes are validated using uvx ty type checker
- **FR-015**: System MUST achieve at least 80% type coverage after all fixes are complete

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Type Annotation**: Represents type information for variables, functions, and classes
- **Factory Function**: Environment creation functions that need proper type annotations
- **Import Statement**: Code import mechanisms that require conditional handling for optional dependencies
