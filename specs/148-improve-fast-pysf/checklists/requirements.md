# Specification Quality Checklist: Improve fast-pysf Integration

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: October 29, 2025  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

**Validation Results**: All checklist items pass. The specification is comprehensive and ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.

**Key Strengths**:
- Clear prioritization of user stories (P1: test execution and code quality, P2: unified standards, P3: type annotations)
- Comprehensive coverage of PR #236 review comments (24 items catalogued)
- Well-defined success criteria with measurable targets
- Proper boundary between "what" (spec) and "how" (implementation)

**Assumptions Documented**:
1. fast-pysf tests are currently runnable independently (verified: true, via `uv run python -m pytest fast-pysf/tests/`)
2. Main robot_sf tests are stable baseline (~43 tests passing)
3. PR #236 review comments represent complete set of known issues
4. Subtree workflow is preferred over submodule (already migrated)
5. Upstream coordination for fast-pysf fixes is acceptable for some issues

**Dependencies**:
- Existing pytest configuration in `pyproject.toml`
- Existing quality gate tools (ruff, ty, coverage) already configured for robot_sf
- Access to PR #236 review comments (confirmed: 24 comments retrieved)
- FastPysfWrapper as integration boundary maintained
